## Building

> [!NOTE]
> Unless you plan on modifying source code you should fork this repository and use the provided workflow.

<summary>Instructions</summary>

> These steps assume you use macOS.

1. Install Xcode from the App Store. If you've previously installed the `Command Line Utilities` package, you will need to run `sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer` to make sure you're using the Xcode tools instead.

> If you want to revert the `xcode-select` change, run `sudo xcode-select -switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk`

2. Install the required dependencies. You can do this by running `brew install make ldid` in your terminal. If you do not have brew installed, follow the instructions [here](https://brew.sh/).

3. Setup your gnu make path:

```bash
export PATH="$(brew --prefix make)/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"
```

4. Setup [theos](https://theos.dev/docs/installation-macos) by running the script provided by theos.

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theos/theos/master/bin/install-theos)"
```

If you've already installed theos, you can run `$THEOS/bin/update-theos` to make sure it's up to date.

5. Clone this repository via `git clone git@github.com:unbound-app/loader-ios.git` and `cd` into it.

6. To build, you can run `make package`.

The resulting `.deb` file will be in the `packages` folder.
